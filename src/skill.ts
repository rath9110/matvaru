# Willys Grocery CLI

A CLI tool for shopping at Willys.se (Swedish grocery store).

Credentials are read from WILLYS_USERNAME and WILLYS_PASSWORD environment variables,
or from a .env file in the current directory. They can also be passed with -u and -p flags.

## Commands

### Search for products

\`\`\`bash
# Search for products (default 10 results)
willys-cli search mjölk

# Search with a specific number of results (fetches multiple pages if needed)
willys-cli search "ekologisk mjölk" 20
\`\`\`

Output includes product name, brand, volume, price, compare price, and product code.

### Browse categories

\`\`\`bash
# List all top-level categories (with 2 levels of subcategories)
willys-cli categories

# Browse products in a specific category
willys-cli browse frukt-och-gront/frukt/citrusfrukt
\`\`\`

Category paths use the URL-style paths shown in the categories output (e.g. \`kott-chark-och-fagel/korv\`).

### Cart operations

\`\`\`bash
# Show current cart
willys-cli cart

# Add a product (product code from search results, optional quantity defaults to 1)
willys-cli add 101233933_ST 2

# Remove a product
willys-cli remove 101233933_ST

# Clear entire cart
willys-cli clear
\`\`\`

Cart-modifying operations (add, remove, clear) print the updated cart after each change.

### Batch operations from CSV file

\`\`\`bash
willys-cli -i shopping-list.csv
\`\`\`

CSV format (one operation per line, lines starting with # are ignored):
\`\`\`
add,101233933_ST,2
add,101205823_ST,1
remove,101233933_ST
cart
clear
\`\`\`

## Product codes

Product codes look like \`101233933_ST\` or \`100126409_KG\`. They are shown in parentheses
in search and browse output. Always use the exact code from the output.

## Typical workflow

1. Search for a product: \`willys-cli search mjölk\`
2. Pick a product code from the results
3. Add it to cart: \`willys-cli add 101233933_ST 2\`
4. Review the cart: \`willys-cli cart\`
